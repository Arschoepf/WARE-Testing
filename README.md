# WMTU/WAVE Audio Ripper-Editor

## About
This is a program designed to automate the adding, removing, and editing of headers of wave audio files. This project was started because of the use of the Wide Orbit automation system at my college radio station, WMTU. The system uses the Scott Studios proprietary 'scot' header and is not able to import metadata from other header types.
