# WMTU/WAVE Audio Ripper-Editor

## About
This is a program designed to automate the adding, removing, and editing of headers of wave audio files. This project was started because of the use of the Wide Orbit automation system at my college radio station, WMTU. The system uses the Scott Studios proprietary 'scot' header and is not able to import metadata from other header types.

## Project Goals
The end goal of this project is to streamline our ingestion process and enable better categorization of our library. Due to the age of the library and turnover of volunteer staff, there are a significant amount of errors that need to be corrected. Once done, music ingestion, categorization, and filtering should be automated and need minimal oversight.


Some goals for this project:
- Convert and encode metadata into wave files
- Filter songs based on lyrics to be allowed to play at different hours
- Sort music by genre and popularity
- Rip audio from CDs
- Integrate with a MusicMaster database to scan for duplicate, deleted, or mismatched entries
